What Drives the Price of a Used Car?

Final Report Summary for Used Car Dealership Group

📌 Business Objective
The goal of this analysis was to identify the key factors that influence the price of used cars, using a dataset of car listings. By understanding which features most impact pricing, dealerships can make better-informed decisions about inventory selection, pricing strategy, and identifying undervalued vehicles.

📌 Primary Findings
After cleaning the data and fitting a regularized Ridge regression model (to handle multicollinearity and overfitting), we identified the features with the strongest relationships to car prices.

Top Positive Price Drivers (Features Associated with Higher Prices):

Feature	Coefficient	Count
manufacturer_ferrari	+1.60	64
manufacturer_tesla	+0.67	682
manufacturer_porsche	+0.67	1018
cylinders_12 cylinders	+0.60	160
type_pickup	+0.37	32,507
manufacturer_rover	+0.37	1566

Interpretation:

Luxury and exotic brands (Ferrari, Tesla, Porsche) predictably command higher prices.
12-cylinder engines (rare, high-performance vehicles) are valued higher.
Pickup trucks also tend to sell for higher prices, likely due to demand for utility vehicles.

Top Negative Price Drivers (Features Associated with Lower Prices):

Feature	Coefficient	Count
title_status_parts only	-1.53	125
condition_salvage	-0.99	463
condition_fair	-0.84	5285
fuel_electric	-0.81	1297
title_status_missing	-0.76	593
fuel_hybrid	-0.70	3973

Interpretation:

“Parts only” or “salvage” title status massively reduces value.
Fair or poor vehicle condition lowers price significantly.
Interestingly, electric and hybrid vehicles in this dataset sold at lower prices, likely due to model-year age, battery condition, or limited regional demand in this sample.

📌 Secondary Insights
Year (age of vehicle) had a small positive relationship with price — but much less than brand or title/condition.
Odometer readings (mileage) had a negligible coefficient near zero in this regularized model, suggesting that after adjusting for other factors like brand, type, and condition, mileage’s incremental effect on price was diminished.
Popular manufacturers like Ford, Toyota, and Honda had moderate or slightly positive coefficients, reflecting steady market demand but not premium pricing.

📌 Recommendations for Dealers
Prioritize high-demand makes and body types — luxury brands, pickup trucks, and rare performance vehicles show consistently higher pricing power.
Avoid vehicles with salvage, parts-only, or missing title statuses — these severely hurt resale value.
Invest in inventory with verified good or like-new condition — the price drop-off for “fair” or “salvage” condition is sharp.
Monitor market-specific demand for electric/hybrid vehicles — while their coefficients were negative here, regional demand variations could make these viable in specific locations.
Use feature importance insights like this to support pricing strategy and appraisals during trade-ins.

📌 Next Steps
Integrate real-time market data to track shifts in demand for specific fuel types or vehicle types.
Use separate models for regional markets since pricing behavior varies by location.
Consider adding more vehicle attributes (like battery health for EVs, accident history, etc.) for more precise pricing models.

📌 Final Note
This Ridge regression model prioritized predictive accuracy over statistical p-values (since regularized models don’t produce classic significance tests). Coefficient magnitudes and direction provide clear, actionable guidance on which features most impact price.
